Install Jupyter notebook. Python version >=3.5 is needed.

Table 2: "Baseline characteristics of the population" is generated from BASELINE.ipynb
Table 3: "Gestation-wise baseline characteristics of the population" is generated from BASELINE.ipynb
Table 4: "Significant risks for longer length of stay according to gestation group" is generated from LOS GIT.ipynb

Steps to successfully run individual scripts

BASELINE.ipynb
1. Install and import the required packages - numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, tabulate, plotly, statsmodels, itertools
2. Download any of the three available CSVs in a folder
